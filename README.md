# fermifci_data_repo
This repository holds source code and data for examples published in [1] using the [FermiFCI.jl](https://github.com/rammelmueller/FermiFCI.jl) package.

## Example code
The examples are grouped regarding related physics (harmonic oscillator and box potential). If you want, you can directly run the examples from the respective sub-directories. A detailed description on how to run the code can be found in the `example_code` directory.


## Data and plot scripts
For full visibility, the data used in [1] along with some plot scripts to explore the results are collected in the directories `example_data` and `plot_scripts`. To run the evaluation scripts you need to have Python 3 installed along with the packages `matplotlib`, `pandas` and `scipy`.
